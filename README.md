# Introduction to GruntJS
#### Profero Tech Talk
*Friday 17th January, 2014*

This contains the presentation I gave for the tech talk on Friday the 17th of January about GruntJS, the popular JS task runner.

The presentation was built using [Cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver), which turns a single markdown file into a full presentation in just 1 command, and a little bit of custom CSS. &hearts;
